//You might want to use a separate file that contains functions for performing specific SQL queries you'll need to use. A constructor function or class could be helpful for organizing these.
//You might also want to make your queries asynchronous. MySQL2 exposes a `.promise()` function on Connections 
//to upgrade an existing non-Promise connection to use Promises. To learn more and make your queries asynchronous, 
//refer to the [npm documentation on MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2).
